      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p>As a senior instructional specialist in a Full Mern Stack Bootcamp, I've played many roles.  I explain basic javascript concepts and how they can be applied to solve basic problems. I teach students how to write quality code and follow industry wide standards.  I often soothe nerves and swoop in to save last minute emergency deployment problems. As each one on one zoom session occurs I have to diagnose the issues with code, pay attention to clues that the student might not grasp the concept, connect apis and libraries that I've never seen before.  I've helped make code that fills me with pride; but my biggest pride lies in the careers I've launched and the lives that I've changed.</p>
