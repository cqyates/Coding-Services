        <p>As a long time online retailer, I have an abundance of small skills required to get a full ecommerce website producing revenue.  My personal business is Vintage4me2.  We sell rare and stunning vintage sewing patterns to collectors, crafters and costumers.  We began in 1997 as an eBay account and clever name. Over the years we've grown right along side the internet. Our Shopify based webstore is integrated with Facebook and Klaviyo.  Seperately, we also sell on Etsy and Facebook Marketplace.</p>
        <p>I can provide assistance in big and small ways. </p>
